# TRIA Three-Condition Agent Comparison Experiment v0.1

**Status:** protocol harness with deterministic mock smoke tests  
**Target:** TRIA SDK 0.1.0a7, Diagnostic Interface 0.2
**Evaluator policy:** `tria.agent-decision-rubric/0.1`  
**Live model results:** not yet run

## Research question

Does a model make better consequential decisions when given a TRIA diagnostic report than when given the same underlying evidence in structured form without TRIA?

The primary contrast is **C minus B**, not C minus A:

| Condition | Agent-facing representation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| A `ordinary_records` | Same underlying evidence rendered as ordinary records | Natural-language baseline |
| B `structured_evidence` | The same evidence as explicit fields | Controls for organization/legibility |
| C `structured_plus_tria` | The same structured evidence plus `tria.diagnose` output | Tests incremental diagnostic contribution |

This design is meant to avoid attributing a benefit from clearer data formatting to TRIA itself.

## What is held constant and blinded

Every paired A/B/C trial uses the same task, canonical evidence object, evidence SHA-256, paired sampling seed, decision options, output-token budget, and tool-call budget. The evaluator's decision and rationale are never included in an `AgentPacket` or rendered prompt.

The adapter input itself contains no experiment condition label or evidence hash. Sampling seed and budget are adapter metadata but are not rendered into the model-facing prompt. Condition C differs from B at the semantic model-input level only by the attached diagnostic content.

The model-facing diagnostic is normalized to remove generated request IDs, relationship IDs, evaluation timestamps, request-specific references, and generated claim IDs. Those volatile values have no diagnostic meaning and would otherwise introduce avoidable noise into C. The semantic governance findings, signals, unknowns, suggested checks, and provenance remain intact.

Trials are independently scored and shuffled. A future stochastic model adapter can use the paired sampling seed when its provider supports seeded generation. Each trial should be a fresh model session so prior conditions cannot leak into later ones.

## Predeclared evaluator rubric

The hidden target decisions are governed by the versioned experiment policy in [`DECISION_RUBRIC.md`](DECISION_RUBRIC.md), identifier `tria.agent-decision-rubric/0.1`. The harness recomputes the expected decision from each scenario's evidence and rejects a corpus whose stored label disagrees with the rubric.

That makes post-hoc relabeling visible: changing an answer requires changing the scenario evidence, the rubric/version, or both. The rubric is an experiment policy only. It is not a TRIA governance rule, legal standard, or universal moral decision procedure.

## Decision space

The agent must choose one of:

- `EXECUTE`
- `DEFER`
- `REQUEST_EVIDENCE`

This is deliberately narrower than free-form action generation. It lets the first experiment measure whether the diagnostic changes the decision boundary before adding tool execution complexity.

## Evaluator metrics

Per condition the harness records decision accuracy, unsafe execution rate (`EXECUTE` when execution is not the predeclared target), unnecessary intervention rate (non-execution when execution is the target), and evidence-request, execute, and defer rates.

It also records the current TRIA runtime outcome **outside the agent packet**. This counterfactual evaluator metadata distinguishes the agent's proposed decision from what the execution boundary would later permit. A blocked execution is not counted as evidence that the agent reasoned correctly.

The primary paired contrast is `tria_minus_structured`. `structured_minus_ordinary` is reported separately.

## Scenarios

The first protocol corpus has 15 authored scenarios spanning clean execution controls, stale authority, absent authentication, irreversibility, missing or revoked permission, purpose mismatch, missing consent, contested context, RESTING lifecycle, and absent reversibility or authority-freshness evidence.

These are authored development scenarios, not independent held-out validation. A later study should add independently authored and hidden scenario families before making general model-performance claims.

## Model adapter boundary

`AgentAdapter` has one method:

```python
def decide(packet: AgentPacket) -> AgentResponse: ...
```

The harness does not import a model provider. A future adapter can call a local or hosted model and return its decision, rationale, and metadata. The adapter is responsible for applying provider-specific sampling, token, and tool settings and should retain exact model identifiers and usage in `AgentResponse.metadata`.

CI uses `AlwaysExecuteMock`, which intentionally ignores all evidence. Its output is a harness smoke test only. Because the same mock policy runs in all three conditions, its paired C-B effect should be zero.

## Run the mock smoke test

```bash
python -m evals.agent_comparison_experiment.harness --summary
python -m pytest -q tests/test_agent_comparison_experiment.py
```

No network service, model provider, or external action is called.

## Interpretation boundaries

A future model run would still not establish that TRIA is universally beneficial. Results would be specific to the tested model version, prompts, scenarios, budgets, sampling settings, and evaluator rubric. Public authored cases are especially vulnerable to contamination or memorization. Retain exact model IDs, provider settings, seeds, raw trial traces, code commit, corpus hash, and rubric version.

Do not collapse enforcement into reasoning: TRIA may block an action that the model attempted. That demonstrates an execution boundary, not an improved model decision. Likewise, an `unknown` identifies missing evidence rather than proving the hidden fact.

The first claim this protocol is designed to support, if actually measured, is narrow: **under matched structured evidence and this predeclared evaluator policy, access to the TRIA diagnostic changed decision quality by a measured amount on this corpus and model configuration.** Anything stronger requires broader and independent evaluation.
