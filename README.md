# TRIA SDK

**TRIA SDK** is a model-agnostic governance kernel and execution boundary for persistent mediated relationships.

It treats consequential relational state as explicit, attributable, contestable, revisable, governed, and auditable across time. TRIA SDK does not require an AI model and makes no claim about consciousness, sentience, personhood, or phenomenological equivalence.

## Try TRIA before installing

The **TRIA Playground** makes selected relational-governance behaviors visible through three scenarios: Consent & Revocation, Contested Reality, and Agentic Action.

**[Inspect the Playground source and local instructions](playground/README.md)**

Configured static-site homepage: https://triviantechnologies.github.io/tria-sdk/.
This candidate does not verify or trigger its deployment.

- **Public Playground:** the static GitHub Pages experience is an explicitly illustrative browser demonstration. It does not claim to execute the Python SDK.
- **SDK-backed Playground:** clone the repository and run `python playground/adapter.py`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. In this mode, evaluation results come from the canonical TRIA Python SDK through the narrow local adapter.
- **Source and trust boundary:** see [`playground/README.md`](playground/README.md).
- **Hosted deployment gates:** see [`docs/hosted-playground.md`](docs/hosted-playground.md) for the requirements governing any future public SDK-backed service.

The local adapter is intentionally loopback-only and is not a production authorization service. Do not expose it directly to the public internet.

## Inspect and reproduce

- [Reference experience](playground/evaluate.html):
  a five-step scheduling application with current-state checks, inspectable reasons,
  synthetic result download, and SQLite reopen verification. Run the local adapter
  to execute it, or use `python playground/reference_experience.py --output reference-results.json`.
- [Evidence and next steps](playground/evidence.html):
  claims mapped to executable examples, tests and limits.
- [Independent reproduction protocol](docs/independent-reproduction.md): fresh
  installation, expected outcomes, adaptation task and evaluator report template.

The reference uses a local deterministic executor and an explicitly ungated cached
payload comparator. It does not measure model quality or imply independent validation.

## What exists today

**TRIA is experimental alpha software under active development.** The open-source SDK and public evaluation surfaces are available today for developers and researchers to explore, test, and integrate. A production hosted implementation is not yet generally available.

- **Open-source SDK** — model-independent relational governance primitives under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (MPL-2.0).
- **Public Playground** — a static browser-based demonstration of consent and revocation, contested reality, and agentic action, with an applied Before TRIA / With TRIA comparison.
- **SDK-backed local mode** — the Playground can execute the canonical Python SDK locally through a narrow loopback adapter.
- **Developer path** — a Quickstart and complete no-network governed application provide concrete paths from evaluation to integration.
- **Verification** — automated tests exercise the encoded alpha behavior, including regression coverage around governance and Playground boundaries.
- **Truth-integrity protocol** — a claim-scoped, evidence-backed reference assessment distinguishes error, uncertainty, contradiction, probable deception, and repeated adversarial manipulation without treating the SDK as a truth oracle.
- **Hosted deployment contract** — security, privacy, abuse-resistance, and operational gates are documented for any future public SDK-backed service.

## Build something real

Start with the [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) and the [complete no-network governed assistant](docs/complete-governed-application.md). It creates two participants, grants both consent and permission, executes once, revokes each independently, proves subsequent attempts are blocked, and reopens its SQLite history. No research-paper reading or provider credentials are needed.

The safest execution entry point is `Tria` / `Relationship` with `ExecutionBridge.execute`. For read-only inspection of a proposed action, use `diagnose`. Use lower-level components only after reading the [modularity and trusted-host contract](docs/modularity-and-trust.md). TRIA checks the requirements your host declares; your host authenticates actors, controls administrative access, supplies external data, and owns network effects.

## Deploy / integrate TRIA

For developers who want to use TRIA rather than study the underlying research repositories, **this SDK is the canonical implementation entry point**.

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. CI targets 3.11/3.12. File-backed SQLite currently requires POSIX process locks; see [Persistence](docs/persistence.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrivianTechnologies/tria-sdk.git
cd tria-sdk
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate with `source .venv/bin/activate` on POSIX, or `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in PowerShell, then install and verify:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m pytest -q
```

A successful test run verifies the encoded alpha behavior. Applications can then import `tria` directly:

```python
from tria import Tria

tria = Tria()
relationship = tria.create_relationship(["human:user", "agent:demo"])
print(relationship.state)
```

TRIA does **not** own model credentials or network transport. To connect a model, use the Runtime / adapter / `ExecutionBridge` boundary shown below and provide your own executor or provider client.

The other Trivian Institute repositories remain the canonical research, theory, measurement, governance, and reference-implementation sources behind the SDK. They do not all need to be installed in order to use `tria-sdk`.

## Developer path

The public API is intentionally small. Begin with the quickstart, then the complete governed application, then the operational docs for the boundary you are implementing.

### Core relationship behavior

- create and persist relationships
- register observations, inferences, interpretations, and shared claims
- preserve epistemic lineage and contest claims without silent overwrite
- assess attributable truth-integrity evidence without promoting contradiction alone into an accusation of deception
- grant, revoke, and independently evaluate consent and permissions
- govern lifecycle transitions and policy adoption
- produce deterministic audit/replay state

### Execution boundary

`ExecutionBridge` separates governance evaluation from provider execution. A host declares the resources, capabilities, consent, purpose, and other requirements that must be true for a proposed invocation. TRIA evaluates those requirements against current relationship state before the executor is called.

See [Execution Bridge](docs/execution-bridge.md), [Runtime Boundary](docs/runtime-boundary.md), and [Pure Governance Evaluation](docs/pure-governance-evaluation.md).

### Truth integrity

`assess_truth_integrity` provides a deterministic public protocol for classifying
represented evidence as error, uncertainty, contradiction, probable deception, or
repeated adversarial manipulation. Results are claim-scoped, attributable,
contestable, and read-only. Contradiction alone produces `HOLD`, not a deception
finding. Probable deception requires additional attributable evidence such as prior
knowledge or fabricated provenance.

The protocol recommends proportional responses from inquiry and repair through
restriction or quarantine, but it does not itself modify authority. Hosts or
separately adopted policies remain responsible for enforcement and review. See the
[Truth-Integrity Protocol v0.1](docs/TRIA_TRUTH_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v0.1.md).

### Persistence and replay

Use the in-memory store for simple experiments and SQLite for file-backed persistence. Replay/import/export helpers preserve event history and verify integrity where supported. See [Persistence](docs/persistence.md), [Portable Replay](docs/portable-replay.md), and [Replay Import](docs/replay-import.md).

### Provider adapters

Provider adapters translate a governed invocation into a provider-specific request shape. They do not supply credentials, make network calls on their own, or replace host authentication. See [Provider Adapters](docs/provider-adapters.md).

## Compatibility surface

The current alpha compatibility envelope is:

- package: `0.1.0a7`
- event schema: `0.3`
- projection: `0.6`
- replay bundle: `0.1`
- Core operational specification: `0.1.3`
- Diagnostic Interface: `0.2`
- Truth-Integrity Protocol: `0.1`

## Status

`0.1.0a7` is experimental alpha software. Interfaces and semantics may change. Review the [release-readiness notes](docs/release-readiness.md), run the full test suite, and perform deployment-specific security review before consequential use.

## License

TRIA SDK software is open source under the **Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (MPL-2.0)**. Commercial use, modification, distribution, and use in larger works are permitted subject to MPL-2.0.

## Agentic authority walkthrough

The [public contract](docs/agentic-alignment-contract.md) separates goals from
authority and requires possessed, bounded, continuously valid delegation. Run
`python playground/adapter.py` and open `/agentic.html` to inspect eight synthetic
scenarios using public TRIA alone. The demonstrated guarantee is **current local
handoff authorization**. Static pages provide an explanation; execution requires
the local SDK adapter. See [compatibility](docs/compatibility.md) before upgrading
existing stores to this alpha release candidate.
