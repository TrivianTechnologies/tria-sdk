# TRIA Playground

**See what changes when relationship becomes part of the architecture.**

The Playground has two deliberately distinct execution modes: the dependency-free browser visualization in `index.html`, and a narrow local HTTP adapter in `adapter.py` that executes the core scenarios through the canonical TRIA Python SDK.

## Start with the applied comparison

[`before-with-tria.html`](before-with-tria.html) presents a plain-language **Before TRIA / With TRIA** comparison. It follows a familiar AI-assistant case: a scheduling preference was stored, persistent-context consent is later revoked, and the agent subsequently attempts to use the historical preference.

The comparison is deliberately illustrative and does not claim that every non-TRIA system behaves identically. It exists to make the architectural distinction legible before a visitor explores the lower-level scenarios.

## Core scenarios

1. **Consent & Revocation** — inspect how current consent and READ permission affect a proposed use of relational context.
2. **Contested Reality** — preserve an observation, an interpretation derived from it, and a participant dispute without silently collapsing them into one fact.
3. **Agentic Action** — inspect current action consent and ACT authority before a simulated consequence.

## SDK-backed local mode

From an editable checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python playground/adapter.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.

The adapter serves an exact allowlist of HTML pages (`/`, `/index.html`,
`/before-with-tria.html`, `/evaluate.html`, `/evidence.html`, `/agentic.html`), `GET /healthz`,
and the allowlisted `POST /api/scenario`, `POST /api/reference`, and
`POST /api/agentic` endpoints. The server binds to loopback by default and requires JSON for scenario requests.

## Trust boundary

The adapter is intentionally narrow. Browser input can select only a known scenario and, where applicable, `consent` or `permission` revocation. The optional exact boolean `state` object
selects consent/permission or dispute state instead of revocation mode. Each UI
evaluation creates a fresh fixture matching those switches; it is not an edit to
an earlier relationship. The adapter rejects unknown fields, non-boolean switch
values, and mixed state/revoke requests. Each request creates fresh in-memory TRIA state. Responses are explicit safe projections containing scenario outcomes, limited audit booleans, and event type/actor/sequence only.

The browser never receives `Relationship`, `rel.admin`, stores, provider credentials, raw event payloads, hashes, arbitrary resources, arbitrary action text, or an arbitrary executor. The endpoint does not execute shell commands, model calls, calendar calls, or other external consequences.

This is a demonstration adapter, not host authentication, a production authorization service, security certification, empirical validation, or a claim of complete SDK conformance. The canonical executable behavior remains the Python package and its tests.

## Public and static mode

The GitHub Pages surface is an educational deterministic visualization. When the local adapter is available, the main UI detects it and labels SDK-produced results separately. A public SDK-backed service requires the independent deployment boundary described in [`../docs/hosted-playground.md`](../docs/hosted-playground.md).

## Commercial boundary

This public Playground demonstrates what selected TRIA relational primitives mean. It is not the enterprise deployment console. Fleet observability, organizational policy management, managed integrations, enterprise analytics, and proprietary augmentation are separate product and trust surfaces.

## License

Software in this directory follows the repository software license unless a file states otherwise. Documentation follows the repository documentation license. See the repository root licensing files for controlling terms.

## Reference experience and evidence

Open `/evaluate.html` on the local adapter to run the five-step scheduling reference.
The same runner works from the command line:

```bash
python playground/reference_experience.py --output reference-results.json
```

The reference endpoint accepts an empty JSON object only. It creates a temporary
SQLite store using synthetic data, runs five authorization states, closes/reopens
the store to verify history, then deletes that temporary store. Its response is a
safe synthetic projection: decisions/reasons, executor entry counts, deterministic
suggestions, diagnostic summary/unknowns, event metadata, provenance and checks.
It never accepts arbitrary actors, documents, actions, model settings or executors.
Report provenance includes actual SDK/Python versions, Git commit/dirty status
when available, and fingerprints of the runner and loaded SDK Python sources.
Hashes identify evaluated code; they are not signatures or source authenticity.

The comparison deliberately reuses an initially authorized cached payload without
fresh checks. It is one specified failure pattern. Local timing samples compare
executor-only work with SDK execution including SQLite recording; they do not
isolate governance overhead and are not a performance benchmark.

The browser displays completed results for inspection, not a live paused server
session. Clear results resets the view; Run always constructs a new relationship.
Download saves synthetic result metadata, not a replay bundle or authorization.
Real relationship export remains a separate DISCLOSE-governed operation.

The static public `/evaluate.html` explains how to run locally and does not
fabricate SDK results. A local request failure remains an error. `/evidence.html`
maps scoped claims to source/tests and links the independent reproduction protocol.

## Authority and delegation walkthrough

Open `/agentic.html` with the local adapter, or run
`python playground/agentic_experience.py`. Eight fixed steps expose scoped grants,
bounded delegation, rejected DELEGATE-only issuance, authorized local handoff,
parent revocation, peer instructions, consensus, missing authority and a prepared
ALLOW becoming stale. Exactly two local counter entries are expected. No external
effects, private packages or live agents participate.

`POST /api/agentic` accepts only `{}`. Every request creates fresh synthetic state;
it cannot select actors, permissions, executors or arbitrary input. Its explicit
projection includes principal/subject, capability/resource/purpose/conditions,
expiry, exact grant references, parent activity, current decision and reason.
Parent references are synthetic provenance, not reusable credentials. Source
fingerprints identify evaluated bytes and do not authenticate their origin.

The guarantee is **current local handoff authorization**. Review/reauthorize/abstain
are suggested responses to the actual SDK BLOCK result. Static pages explain the
walkthrough without fabricating SDK results; a failed local run stays an error.
The ten-minute expiry is a demonstration parameter, not an empirical constant.
Health retains the compatible `tria-playground-v0.2` identifier and adds the optional
`agentic_experience` feature flag. Older adapters leave the new run button disabled.

No stored-state migration is needed for these fresh fixtures. SDK 0.1.0a7 requires
event schema 0.3 / projection 0.6; see [compatibility](../docs/compatibility.md).
Run `python -m pytest tests/test_agentic_playground.py tests/test_agentic_alignment.py`
and the full SDK suite. Hosted public execution remains a separately gated deployment.
