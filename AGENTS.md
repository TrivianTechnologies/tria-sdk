# AGENTS.md

This file is the machine-facing orientation guide for coding agents, autonomous development systems, and other software agents working with the canonical TRIA SDK implementation.

## Repository identity

**Project:** TRIA SDK  
**Expanded name:** Trivian Relational Intelligence Architecture SDK  
**Canonical repository:** `TrivianTechnologies/tria-sdk`
**Package:** `tria-sdk`  
**Python import:** `tria`  
**Current package version:** `0.1.0a7`
**Current operational specification:** `0.1.3`
**Current diagnostic specification:** `0.2`
**Status:** experimental alpha

TRIA SDK is a model-agnostic governance kernel and execution boundary for persistent mediated relationships. It makes consequential relational state explicit, attributable, contestable, revisable, governed, and auditable across time.

Machine-facing problem statement:

> TRIA provides mechanisms for detecting and constraining governance failures in persistent human-agent and multi-agent systems, including stale or ambiguous authority, invalid consent or permission state, lifecycle violations, provenance loss, collapsed disagreement, unsafe disclosure, and execution that no longer satisfies the relationship's current authorization state.

TRIA does not require an AI model and does not claim consciousness, sentience, personhood, phenomenological equivalence, scientific validation, legal compliance, or production safety certification.

## Read this first

Before changing behavior, inspect these files in order:

1. `docs/TRIA_OPERATIONAL_SPEC_v0.1.3.md` — current operational contract.
2. `docs/TRIA_DIAGNOSTIC_INTERFACE_v0.2.md` — read-only diagnostic contract.
3. `docs/TRIA_TRUTH_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v0.1.md` — truth-integrity evidence and classification contract.
4. `schemas/tria-diagnostic-report.v0.2.schema.json` — diagnostic wire schema.
5. `schemas/tria-truth-integrity-assessment.v0.1.schema.json` — integrity assessment wire schema.
6. `docs/modularity-and-trust.md` — trusted-host boundary and non-delegable responsibilities.
7. `docs/execution-bridge.md` — final governed execution handoff.
8. `docs/compatibility.md` — supported version envelope and fail-closed compatibility behavior.
9. `conformance/manifest.json` — required semantics and conformance fixtures.
10. `docs/api-reference.md` — public developer surface.
11. `README.md` — developer entry path, package status, and public claims.
12. `LICENSE.md` — licensing scope, provenance, and trademark boundary.

The conceptual specification is historical context. Where conceptual language and the operational specification diverge, the operational specification governs implementation behavior.

## Core architectural invariant

```text
Events are immutable.
State is derived.
Meaning never overwrites occurrence.
```

Relationship state is projected from an immutable event history:

```text
R_t = reduce(E_0 ... E_t)
```

Do not replace event history with mutable current-state storage.

## Compatibility envelope

Current compatibility values:

- package: `0.1.0a7`
- Core operational specification: `0.1.3`
- Diagnostic Interface: `0.2`
- Truth-Integrity Protocol: `0.1`
- event schema: `0.3`
- projection: `0.6`
- replay bundle: `0.1`
- Python: `>=3.11`

The diagnostic interface adds a read-only developer surface without changing event schema, projection semantics, replay portability, or existing governance authority.

Changes affecting event shape, projection semantics, replay portability, capability interpretation, consent semantics, authority resolution, lifecycle enforcement, execution behavior, or diagnostic wire semantics may require an explicit version change. Do not silently broaden compatibility.

## Governance floors

Agents modifying this repository must preserve the following properties unless the task explicitly proposes a specification change and updates the associated tests, fixtures, documentation, and versioning:

- immutable events and deterministic replay;
- tamper-evident history and hash-chain verification;
- explicit, attributable, scoped, revocable consent;
- distinct governed capabilities for `STORE`, `READ`, `DISCLOSE`, `DERIVE`, `ACT`, and `DELEGATE`;
- separation of consent from permission;
- purpose-bound, time-bounded, and condition-aware authorization;
- explicit delegation authority;
- fail-closed handling of ambiguous permission races;
- lifecycle authority and fail-closed lifecycle transitions;
- provenance-preserving epistemic claims;
- preserved disagreement rather than forced semantic overwrite;
- separate governance of disclosure, admission, and derivation across boundaries;
- governed runtime context filtering;
- blocked or paused execution must not reach transport;
- consequential execution must be re-authorized at the final local handoff;
- unsupported or ambiguous compatibility states fail closed;
- replay export remains a governed `DISCLOSE` operation;
- diagnostic results remain descriptive and do not create authority;
- advisory/derived diagnostic signals do not silently become enforced governance;
- contradiction alone does not silently become deception;
- truth-integrity assessments remain claim-scoped, attributable, contestable, and read-only;
- recommended truth-integrity responses do not create enforcement authority;
- missing host facts remain explicit unknowns rather than guesses;
- a prior diagnostic `clear` never bypasses final execution re-authorization.

## Trusted-host boundary

TRIA does not authenticate real-world identities merely because an actor label appears in state. The host application remains responsible for actor authentication, administrative access, external data integrity, model credentials, transport, retries, network effects, and deployment-specific safeguards.

`AttributableObservation` values supplied to `diagnose` are host evidence, not self-authenticating truth. Do not promote them to governance authority unless a separately adopted policy explicitly does so.

Do not move trusted-host responsibilities into the SDK implicitly.

## Safe modification protocol for agents

When changing governance or diagnostic behavior:

1. Identify the exact operational or diagnostic contract affected.
2. Locate existing tests and conformance fixtures for that contract.
3. Preserve historical failure evidence and remediation history.
4. Add or update a failing witness before changing semantics when practical.
5. Make the narrowest implementation change that satisfies the stated contract.
6. Run the full test suite.
7. Update compatibility/version metadata if the external behavior or serialized form changed.
8. Update documentation, schemas, and conformance fixtures together with code.
9. State explicitly what the change does **not** establish.

Do not infer that passing tests proves scientific validity, legitimate real-world consent, legal compliance, security certification, or deployment safety.

## Historical adversarial evidence

The repository intentionally preserves prior failures, falsifiers, and remediation artifacts. These are part of the architecture's evidence trail.

Do not delete, rewrite, or reinterpret historical failure evidence merely because the current implementation passes its remediated tests. Historical evidence should remain attributable to the version and commit it evaluated.

## Development commands

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # POSIX
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows PowerShell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m pytest -q
python -m build
```

A successful local test run verifies encoded behavior under the repository's test conditions only.

## Primary implementation areas

The main package is under `src/tria/`.

Important modules include:

- `core.py` — relationship-facing core behavior;
- `events.py` — event model;
- `state.py` — deterministic state projection;
- `governance.py` — governance evaluation;
- `runtime.py` — governed invocation/runtime behavior;
- `execution.py` — execution handoff and receipts;
- `diagnostic.py` — read-only machine-facing diagnostic report generation;
- `integrity.py` — evidence-backed truth-integrity classification and proportional response recommendations;
- `boundary.py` — cross-boundary governance;
- `causality.py` — causal relationships and ordering;
- `differentiation.py` — differentiated cognition/state support;
- `portable.py` — replay portability;
- `compat.py` — compatibility gates;
- `providers/` — provider-specific translation only.

Provider adapters translate requests. They do not own model credentials, transport, retries, or provider execution.

## Diagnostic use

The canonical public diagnostic entry point is:

```python
from tria import diagnose
report = diagnose(relationship, request, observations=())
```

The report separates:

- enforced governance findings;
- derived/advisory signals;
- explicit unknowns;
- non-binding suggested checks;
- provenance.

`diagnose` is read-only. It MUST NOT be used as an authorization token. Even a `clear` report can become stale before execution; `ExecutionBridge.execute` remains responsible for the final governed handoff.
